<title>Kernel-level timestamps in clink</title>

<h1>Kernel-level timestamps in clink</h1>

Allen B. Downey

<p>
As part of a research project pertaining to bandwidth estimation
in wide-area networks, I wrote a program called clink that is
a reimplementation of Van Jacobson's pathchar.

<p>
One of the experiments I performed involved kernel-level timestamps.
That is, when the kernel is preparing an outgoing UDP packet, it
sneaks a timestamp into the packet, and when an incoming ICMP packet
arrives, the kernel sneaks another timestamp in.

<p>
The advantage of this system is that it eliminates two sources of
delay from the measured elapsed time:

<ol>

<li> The time between when a process writes an outgoing packet
and when the OS actually sends the packet.

<li> The time between the arrival of a packet and the time when
the receiving process is scheduled.

</ol>

<p>
In general, we expect these delays to be small compared with
delays in the network.  I didn't make a thorough study of the
effect of kernel-level measurements, but my initial impression
was that they were not likely to provide a significant benefit
for the application I was working on, and I abandoned the
technique.

<p>
Here is a <a href="downey03hack.tar.gz">compressed tar file</a>
that contains the following files:

<pre>
collect.c     The data collection module of clink
udp.c         A slightly modified version of the file
	      from the Linux kernel source.
icmp.c        A slightly modified version of the file
	      from the Linux kernel source.
</pre>

<p>
I orginally made these changes in Red Hat Linux 6.2.
I don't remember what Linux kernel that was.

<p>
In order to reimplement this hack, it would be best to
look at the changes I made in udp.c and icmp.c and make
similar changes in the current versions of the same files.

<p>
You can find the changes by searching for the string
"Allen" in the source files.

<p>
There is good documentation elsewhere on how to recompile
and install the modified kernel.

<p>
As far as I know, these hacks don't interfere with the normal
function of udp and icmp.  They only affect packets that happen
to have the string "&lt;clink!&gt;" in the packet body.  I suppose
that could happen by accident, but it's unlikely.

<p>
To see the interface to the timestamps from user code, see
collect.c in the clink source code, and search for the string
"kernel".
