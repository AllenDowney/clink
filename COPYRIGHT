Copyright information for CLINK
-------------------------------

Clink was written by Allen Downey (downey@colby.edu), based on
pathchar, a similar program written by Van Jaconbson.  The interface
of clink is based on the interface of pathchar, and the underlying
mechanism is based on Jacobson's description of pathchar.  No pathchar
source code is included in clink.  I think there are no copyright
issues with respect to pathchar, but I would like to acknowledge
my debt to Van Jacobson for his ideas, his description of pathchar
in his slides, and the "look and feel" of pathchar, which I
emulated (although with significant modifications).

Clink is also based on trout, which is a simple version of traceroute
written by Allen Downey, but which is heavily based on the version of
traceroute W. Richard Stevens presents in "UNIX Network Programming
Volume 1, Second Edition Networking APIs: Sockets and XTI," Prentice
Hall PTR, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.

The copyright for Stevens's version of traceroute is held by Prentice
Hall, but they make it available under a license that is more or less
identical to the GNU GPL.  Therefore I think it is legal for me to
make clink available under the GNU GPL (explained below).

With all that explanation, then...
